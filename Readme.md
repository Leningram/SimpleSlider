A __simple__ but __beautiful__ version of an _image slider_ with animation for any website

As most of sliders it's based on adding and removing style class _"active"_ to an image but it uses animation with transition _ease-in-out_ so it looks more pretty.

It can be used in a marketplaces or ecommerce for example.
